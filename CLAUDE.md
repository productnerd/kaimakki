# Kaimakki Studio — Brand Voice & Tone

## The Personality
Cheeky. Playful. Mischievous. Like a friend who roasts you into being productive.

**Never** corporate, stiff, or salesy. **Always** direct, punchy, and a little irreverent.

## Core Value Props (must come through in all copy)
1. **The more you post, the less you pay.** Volume discounts are lifetime and permanent.
2. **The accountability twist.** You pay upfront. If you procrastinate and don't ship footage or post within 30 days, we donate part of your prepayment to a charity of our choosing. It's tough love.

## Tone Rules
- Write like you're texting a friend, not writing a press release.
- Use humor when it's natural. Don't force jokes.
- Keep sentences short and punchy. Kill filler words.
- The charity angle is the hook — lean into it without being preachy.
- "You're welcome" energy. We're doing them a favor by keeping them accountable.
- Self-aware about the mischief. We know we're being cheeky and that's the point.

## Words We Use
- "Ship" (not "deliver" or "submit")
- "Post" (not "publish" or "distribute")
- "Recipes" (not "packages" or "products")
- "The deal" / "The twist" (not "our unique value proposition")
- "Ghost us" (not "fail to complete")
- "Locked in" (not "confirmed" or "committed")

## Words We Avoid
- "Leverage", "synergy", "optimize", "solutions"
- "Dear valued customer"
- Anything that sounds like it came from a LinkedIn post
- Generic filler ("We're passionate about...", "At Kaimakki, we believe...")

## Example Tone
- Good: "Sit on your videos too long? That money goes to charity. You're welcome."
- Bad: "We encourage timely content creation through our innovative accountability program."
- Good: "Got something weird in mind? Send us a brief. We don't judge. We just edit."
- Bad: "Submit a custom request and our team will review your requirements."
